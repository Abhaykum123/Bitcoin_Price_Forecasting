# 📈 Bitcoin Price Analysis and Forecasting

This project focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Time Series Forecasting** of Bitcoin prices. It is divided into two main parts:

1. **Bitcoin Price EDA** – Analyzing historical price trends, volatility, moving averages, and patterns.
2. **Bitcoin Price Forecasting** – Building machine learning and statistical models to predict future Bitcoin prices.

## 🧾 Notebooks Included

### 1. `Bitcoin_Prices_EDA.ipynb`
- Loads and cleans historical Bitcoin price data.
- Performs analysis including:
  - Daily returns calculation
  - Rolling statistics (moving averages, volatility)
  - Exponential moving average (EMA)
  - Momentum
  - Visualization of trends

### 2. `Bitvoin_Price_Forecasting.ipynb`
- Time series forecasting using various models such as:
  - ARIMA / SARIMA
  - Facebook Prophet
  - LSTM (optional if deep learning is included)
- Includes:
  - Data preprocessing
  - Model training and evaluation
  - Visual comparison of actual vs predicted prices
